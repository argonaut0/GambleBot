# Gamble Bot

## by Jason Hsu - v0.1.0

Gamble Bot is a discord bot for gambling games in text channels, written
in python with the discord.py library.

This bot started because the other bots didn't have accurate blackjack games.
Also all my friends have gambling problems and this is better for them than
 going to the casino.
